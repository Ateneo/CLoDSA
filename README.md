# CLoDSA

CLoDSA is an open-source image augmentation library for object classification, localization, detection, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. It supports a wide variety of augmentation techniques and allows the user to easily combine them. It can also be applied to lists of images like videos or z-stacks.

## Features

* Several augmentation techniques are provided.
* Augmentation techniques can be applied for object classification, localization, detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation. Augmentation techniques can also be applied to stacks of images (a stack can be, for instance, a z-stack of images acquired with a microscopy or a video). 
* A Java wizard to configure the library.
* Several input modes for reading the datasets.
* Several output modes to generate the augmented dataset. 
* It is possible to easily add new augmentation techniques and apply them for object classification, localization, detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation in both images and videos. 


## Requirements and installation of the library

The library works with Python 2.7 and 3.6, which must be installed. 

The following packages must be installed:

  * numpy
  * scipy
  * scikit-image
  * mahotas
  * imutils
  * keras
  * commentjson
  * h5py
  * scikit_learn
  * progressbar2
  * OpenCV (i.e. `cv2` must be available in python). 
  * Tensorflow.
  * imageio

Once the packages are available, `clodsa` can be installed using the following command

    pip install clodsa

This installs the latest version directly from github. If any error pops up, try adding ``sudo`` in front (i.e. ``sudo pip install clodsa``).

Alternatively, you can install the latest version which was added to pypi via ``pip install clodsa``. That version can sometimes be behind the version on github.

To uninstall the library use ``pip uninstall clodsa``.

## Requirements and installation of the wizard

To install the wizard, you need to follow the instructions provided in the [wizard page](java_wizard/).

## List of augmentation techniques

The following table presents the list of augmenters available in the library and the parameters to configure them. We split them into two groups: those that change the label in the problems of localization, detection and semantic segmentation, and those that do not change the annotation.
